 Welcome to the introduction of the Prusa Core One, the latest 3D printer from one of the most trusted names in the industry. This printer is a powerhouse of features, designed to meet the needs of both hobbyists and professionals. The Core One is a Core XY fully enclosed printer, offering a larger print volume than its predecessors while maintaining a small footprint. Its all-steel exoskeleton frame ensures maximum rigidity, and the compact design allows for a heated bed to raise the internal temperature to 55°C, making it perfect for printing with ABS, ASA, PC, and nylon.

The Core One boasts a motion system with linear rails on the X axis, linear rods on the Y axis, and a three-lead screw supported Z axis, ensuring smooth and precise movements. The X and Y stepper motors are 0.9° motors, which help prevent vertical fine artifacts. The extruder is the same next router with the planetary gear system and 10:1 gearbox ratio as the Prusa XL, Mark IV, and Mark IV S, capable of reaching a maximum nozzle temperature of 290°C.

One of the standout features of the Core One is its bed leveling system. It uses a load cell sensor inside the print head, which probes the bed directly with the nozzle, ensuring accurate and consistent bed leveling. Z offset is set automatically, making the printing process effortless.

The Core One also boasts a 360-degree cooling system, ensuring optimal cooling during printing. It supports NFC and Ethernet connections, and comes with Prusa Connect, allowing you to manage multiple printers easily through the web interface or mobile app. Additionally, the Core One is compatible with the MMU3 for multicolor printing, and optional upgrades include a camera, a filtration system, a GPIO extension board for external device control, and an accelerometer for fine-tuning your input shaper.

In summary, the Prusa Core One is a highly capable and versatile 3D printer, perfect for those looking for a reliable and precise printing experience. Its standout features, including its bed leveling system, cooling system, and connectivity options, make it a top choice for both hobbyists and professionals

 Introduction: Product Definition and Key Features

The Prusa Core One is a Core XY fully enclosed 3D printer available in two versions: a kit version for self-assembly at $950 and a fully assembled version for $1,200. The Core One features an all-steel exoskeleton frame, providing maximum rigidity and a compact design, requiring a table space of 20 x 17 inches (50 x 43 cm) with a vertical space of 22 inches (56 cm). It boasts a print volume of 250 x 220 x 270 mm, slightly larger than the Prusa Mark IV.

The Core One's motion system consists of linear rails on the X-axis, linear rods on the Y-axis, and a three-lead screw-supported Z-axis. The X and Y stepper motors are 0.9-degree motors, helping prevent vertical fine artifacts. The extruder is the same Next Router with a planetary gear system and a 10:1 gearbox ratio as the Prusa XL, Mark IV, and Mark IV S, with a maximum nozzle temperature of 290°C. The bed temperature can reach up to 115°C, and it uses a load cell sensor inside the print head for bed leveling.

The Core One supports NFC for Wi-Fi settings transfer and Ethernet connection, compatible with Prusa Connect for managing multiple printers. It features a 360-degree cooling system and supports multicolor printing with the MMU3 system (though the kit is not yet available). Optional upgrades include a camera, filtration system, GPIO extension board, and accelerometer for input shaper tuning.

 Welcome back to Aurora Tech Channel, where we will be testing Prusa's new 3D printer, the Core One. I have had this machine for about two months and have used it extensively as my primary printer before releasing this review. The Core One is available in two versions: a kit version for $950, which requires self-assembly, and a fully assembled version for $1,200. This Core XY printer has a larger print volume than the Mark IV, measuring 250 by 220 by 270 millimeters. The table space required is approximately 20 by 17 inches (50 by 43 centimeters), and the vertical space required is about 22 inches (56 centimeters). The Core One features an all-steel exoskeleton frame for maximum rigidity and can reach internal temperatures of up to 55 degrees Celsius, making it suitable for printing materials like ABS, ASA, PC, and nylon.

The Core One's motion system uses linear rails on the X-axis, linear rods on the Y-axis, and a three-lead screw supported Z-axis. It is equipped with 0.9-degree stepper motors on the X and Y axes to prevent vertical fine artifacts. The extruder is similar to the one found in the Prusa XL, Mark IV, and Mark IV S, with a maximum nozzle temperature of 290 degrees Celsius and a high-flow CHT nozzle. The bed temperature can reach up to 115 degrees Celsius, and it is compatible with the Prusa Multi-Material Upgrade 3S (MMU3) for multi-color printing.

The printer comes with a double-sided smooth PEI sheet, a color touchscreen, various tools, a power cord, a USB drive, a user manual, and gummy bears. Since the machine arrives fully assembled, setting it up involves placing the print surface and mounting the screen at the front. The user manual recommends inserting the USB drive when turning on the machine for the first time to apply the latest firmware update.

The Core One supports NFC for Wi-Fi setup and cloud configuration, and it can be managed through Prusa Connect,
