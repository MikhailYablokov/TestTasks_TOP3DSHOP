Check the "Introduction: Product Definition and Key Features" section you wrote, check the clarity, coherence, and readability by applying the following strategies. Rewrite it, if necessary.
1. Repeat Named Entities Twice Before Using Attributes:
1.1. Identify the named entity (e.g., companies, people, places) in the text and repeat it at least twice before referring to it with attributes, synonyms, or pronouns.
1.2. Avoid using pronouns (e.g., "its," "their") or synonyms until the named entity has been mentioned sufficiently for clarity and emphasis.
2. Use Anchor Segments to Connect Sentences:
Identify the main topic or key term in each sentence.
2.1. Repeat or refer back to key terms or concepts from previous sentences to create logical connections and smooth transitions.
2.2. Use linking phrases or words (e.g., "for example," "this means," "due to this") to clarify relationships between ideas.
2.3. Introduce new information gradually, ensuring it builds on the previous sentence while maintaining cohesion.
DO NOT APPLY THESE RULES TO THE PROS AND CONS LIST.
